                <hr>
                <p>
                    Hello! I'm Hasan Kerem Demirel, a curious and dedicated second-year CTIS (Computer Technologies and Information Systems) student at Bilkent University. My journey in the world of technology has been a dynamic exploration of various programming languages and their applications.
                    <br><br>
                    When I started university, I've been drawn to the endless possibilities offered by technology. As I've navigated through my academic journey, I've had the opportunity to delve into the range of programming languages, including C, Java, Oracle SQL, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and PHP. Each language has offered its own unique challenges and rewards, contributing to my growth as a versatile and adaptable programmer.
                    <br><br>
                    Outside of programming, I'm an avid learner and creative thinker. I enjoy exploring and engaging in problem-solving challenges, and pursuing creative hobbies such as photography and design. I believe in the importance of continuous learning and personal growth, and I'm always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills every respect of life.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm excited about the prospect of leveraging my diverse skill set to contribute to impactful projects and make a positive difference in the world and its technology.
                </p>
